# Lite-Compression-Tool

A simple lightweight command line tool to compress text files using Huffman coding

Huffman Coding is a data compression algorithm that is used to reduce the size of data without losing any information. It achieves this by assigning shorter binary codes to frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less frequent characters. This technique allows for efficient storage and transmission of data

For this example, a text file lesmiserables.txt included in the repo , text file used contains not only ASCII characters but other characters in any language

## Usage
Clone the Repository, check in on the root folder and run the main.go file, you see a decoded_lesmiserables.txt being generated
